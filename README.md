Hello Everyone!
I'm Making a restaurant billing system project
In this project, a user can add number of food items, their code, quantities and prices.
The motive behind building this project is to enhance programming capabilities and logic building.
In building Restaurant Billing System I've encountered numbers of errors. I kept on solving them.
The current scenario of this project is that I'm facing an error which is hard to detect.
When I compile the code, and run it goes successfully to Running Bill and after that the comiler hangs and doesn't throw any error as well as any other instructions.
Help me out to solve this problem.

Let's contribute.
